# Publication-Topic-Trends-in-Nature
2014 Harvard Intro to Computer Science (CS50) Final project

## About
I was interested in looking at publication trends in Nature, which is one of the major journals scientific journals we look to for cutting edge science. Specifically, I wanted to see whether there are certain topics that are more likely to be published than others, and whether this changes over time  (e.g. biological sciences vs physical sciences). Has there been a recent surge in papers published on the biological sciences or has this been pretty consistent over the past several years? Are there any topics that are hardly represented by Nature? These findings will be informative both in terms of what the "hot" topics in science are and have been, and whether Nature may have some bias towards which kinds of stories it accepts for publication. Ultimately, I think it would be interesting to apply the same analysis to Cell and Science, but I figured I Nature would be a good start.
