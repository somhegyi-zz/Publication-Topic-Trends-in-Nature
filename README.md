## About
For my final project for Harvard's (2014) intro to computer science course, I wanted to get some practice using Python and building a web scraper. To do  achieve these goals, I decided to look at publication trends in _Nature_, which is one of the major journals scientific journals we look to for cutting edge science. Specifically, I wanted to see whether there are certain topics that are more likely to be published than others, and whether this changes over time  (e.g. biological sciences vs physical sciences). Has there been a recent surge in papers published on the biological sciences or has this been pretty consistent over the past several years? Are there any topics that are hardly represented by _Nature_? These findings will be informative both in terms of what the "hot" topics in science are and have been, and whether _Nature_ may have some bias towards which kinds of stories it accepts for publication. Ultimately, I think it would be interesting to apply the same analysis to _Cell_ and _Science_, but I figured I _Nature_ would be a good start.
